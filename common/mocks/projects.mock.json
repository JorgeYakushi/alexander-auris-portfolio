      "description": "Six queer people walk along a route that connects two different nei­ghborhoods in Brussels. They don’t know each other but share the city. They move, act, behave and use it in different ways. Through their eyes, we experience the spaces that the route connects. It is 4.6 km long and passes by the center of Brussels where a theater, a gay street, and a park are located.",

It must be read as a exquisite corpse* in which new narratives were made from a queer perspective to talk about some of the Prishtina Public Archipelago buildings.\nIn order to develop the workshop it was taken into consideration experiences in the space to “queer the map”. So space becomes more a phenomenological platform; experiences and made-up stories are the excuse to convey architecture and the city as a place changing constantly.",

      "description": "The project explores the role of Peruvian architecture in the contemporary social context and how this can be introduced to  an existing building designed 76 years ago. The CAP building is located on Tacna av. In this project, the architect Enrique Seoane, reflected on the cultural layers of Peruvian culture and its representation in architecture. Following this interest, our intervention is understood as the introduction of a new layer that represents the role of architecture today.\nWe understand contemporary architectural design in the Peruvian context as a tool for social inclusion, gathering and transmission of knowledge, and that it must recover the perception of citizenship in architecture as a necessary discipline for the socio-cultural development of the country. This way of seeing the architectural, together with the program proposed for the contest, allows this building to become a new benchmark for inclusion and architectural culture. For this, three strategies are proposed that allow flexibility, accessibility and at the same time maintain the spatial characteristics of the building.",

      "description": "This master thesis relates a community that is present in the city and society, a community that has been hidden for a while, but now it’s out there. The representation in the city of this community could be the gay neighborhoods, but this representation is problematic because they are not inclusive enough. The question of whether or not these spaces are commons starts a discussion about what is shared in queer people. What is really shared in queer people and how is it related to space?\nThe project reflects on this and states three levels of connection between queer people: the spheres. The analysis of these spheres are later presented in Berlin as a case study. The results of these analysis give variables and conditions for the development of the urban and\narchitectural project that is presented.",
